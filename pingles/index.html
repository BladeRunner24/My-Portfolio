                <h3>Education</h3> 
                <p class = "pe">In 2019 I came in touch with programming, and everything you can do with it when I was studying Full Stack Web Development in Acamica. At that moment I get in contact with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also have the opportunity to work with Node JS and MySQL. After I completed my studies I studied React JS in CoderHouse and worked on freelance projects.<br> I also have ample experience in customer service and have a good english level.<br>I hope to use all my experience to help you achieve your goals. If you like please feel free to download my resume from the link that appears below.</p>
